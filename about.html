                        <h3>Web Developer</h3>
                        <p>Since I wrote ‘Hello world.’ In HTML, I got hooked in web development and I have never
                            looked back again. As a self-taught web developer, I am fascinated by how the writing of
                            several lines of code creates something superb. My current expertise is in frontend
                            development and I am on my way to becoming a full stack developer. </p>

                        <h3>Teacher</h3>
                        <p>I’m a secondary school trained teacher by profession. This role has allowed me to expound
                            my skills in other areas around computing. For instance, leading and guiding a team of
                            students in learning computer skills has enhanced my communication, team work,
                            creativity and problem-solving skills.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Vlogger</h3>
                        <p>I have previously done article and academic writing as a freelance. While writing, I used
                            to do a lot of research both in YouTube, and from various sites and blogs. As a result,
                            I have learned blogging and vlogging skills although this is not a field I have direct
                            my energy more. I am however a lifelong learner. </p>
